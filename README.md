# Overview
## Face Detection using Haar Cascade
This project uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in a set of images.
It processes images from the TestImages folder, detects faces, draws bounding boxes, and saves results in OutputImages.
The coordinates of detected faces are stored in a CSV file for further analysis.
